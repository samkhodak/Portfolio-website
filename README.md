### Outside sources

Some of the inspiration for my navbar came from [Kevin Powell's video about responsive navbars.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA)

I used codefoxx's responsive nav tutorial to make some of my nav functionality. [Here's the link to their video.](https://youtu.be/flItyHiDm7E)

For my hamburger menu, I used a [fontawesome icon to open my nav.](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bars?s=solid)

I also used various manuals on [W3Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/)
